# Planetarium

Planetarium is a 2D astromechanical engine to create and simulate systems of planets and stars.

The simulations can be visualized in a pygame GUI.

Planetarium allows to create '.planet' files to define the bodies' (planets or stars) properties and manage simulation cases more easily:
- mass
- initial position
- initial velocity (direction and speed)

Multiple integration methods are available:
- Euler integration
- Verlet integration
- Runge-Kutta methods
- ...
